- Monolith architecture  is where frontend and backend are coupled together in a same src folder without usage of an API
- Demolish this monolith architecture so that we can implement new layer to access backend which is API.
- Fast API is built mainly on two libs
  - Starlette manages how your api receives requests and sends back responses (it uses ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface)
  - Pydantic is a data validation library
- It uses Uvicorn web server which is also a high performance ASGI server
- FastAPI api code uses async and await features
